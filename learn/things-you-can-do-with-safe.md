# Things you can do with Safe

Safe accounts are built to be fully customizable. This means that the only limit to what you can do with a Safe account is your imagination.

See the [Discover](https://docs.safe.global/discover/) section to see examples of how people are building and using Safe.

## Protocols

- Ethereum and 12 other layer 1 (L1) and test networks
- ERC-20s
- Layer two (L2) accounts based on smart contracts

## Layer 2s (L2s)

#### About

- Requires creating a new Safe on each network
- Make sure to use the correct token contract for the given Layer 2 (L2)

#### Types

- Arbitrum
- [Optimism](https://dune.com/safe/optimism)
- [Polygon](https://dune.com/safe/polygon)
- [xDAI](https://dune.com/safe/gnosis-chain) (Gnosis Chain)
- AVAX
- [BSC](https://dune.com/safe/bsc)
- EWC

#### Multichain strategy

- Enable the features of programmable accounts without interacting directly with the contracts.
    - [Account Abstraction is NOT coming](https://safe.mirror.xyz/9KmZjEbFkmI79s28d9xar6JWYrE50F5AHpa5CR12YGI)
- Use a universal readable name/ID to interact across many protocols.
    - E.g. Ethereum Name Service (ENS) maps the name/ID to each chain-specific address.
